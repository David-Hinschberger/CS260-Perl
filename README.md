# CS260-Perl

Git Folder for a course on Perl I took at UND (CS 260).

For most assignments, I did my best to reduce the number of lines a program took, at the cost of efficiency.
It's about the only time I get to do things like that to my code, because assignments are never graded for quality,
simply based on whether they complete the task given.

Let me know if there's any questions (I love explaining the code).
